# Linked Connection Bot
> Automatically send connections requests or withdraw all pending connection requests


After researching this topic online, I noticed that most LinkedIn automation programs are charging outrageous amounts to simply send connection requests.  
	I created this free open source program to do exactly that.

## Installation

- First you need to [download the repo](https://github.com/zdhenard42/Linked_Connect_Bot/archive/refs/tags/V1.0.zip)download the repo and extract the folder to somewhere on your desktop  
- Then you need to download the chromedriver that corresponds with your chrome version.  
	To find your chrome version, paste the following in your address bar:  
	```sh
	chrome://settings/help
	```
  
- After finding your version, go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and download the corresponding chromedriver.  
- Place the chromedriver executable into the folder that contains "MyConnectmenu.py"
- Run MyConnectmenu.py
- Profit


## Usage example

Using this program, you can quickly grow your connections to 1000+ in 1-2 weeks.  
I recommend not sending more than 100 connections a day to avoid a temporary cooldown by LinkedIn

## Development setup
