# Linked Connection Bot
> Automatically send connections requests or withdraw all pending connection requests


After researching this topic online, I noticed that most LinkedIn automation programs are charging outrageous amounts to simply send connection requests.  
	I created this free open source program to do exactly that.

## Installation

- [Download the repo](https://github.com/zdhenard42/Linked_Connect_Bot/archive/refs/tags/V1.0.zip) and extract the folder to somewhere on your desktop 
- Run MyConnectmenu.py
- Profit

## Usage example

Using this program, you can quickly grow your connections 1000+ in 1-2 weeks.  
I recommend not sending more than 100 connections a day to avoid a temporary cooldown by LinkedIn
